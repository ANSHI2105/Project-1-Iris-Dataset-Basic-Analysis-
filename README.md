# Project-1-Iris-Dataset-Basic-Analysis-
## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the analysis performed on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset, consists of measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains four features for each flower:
1.	Sepal Length (in centimeters)
2.	Sepal Width (in centimeters)
3.	Petal Length (in centimeters)
4.	Petal Width (in centimeters)

## Analysis Steps
#### 1. Data Exploration
-	Checked for missing values and ensured data integrity.
-	Explored basic statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for each feature.
-	Visualized the distribution of each feature using histograms.
#### 2. Data Visualization
-	Created scatter plots to examine relationships between different features.
-	Employed pair plots for a comprehensive view of interactions between features.
-	Used box plots to identify variations in measurements across different iris species.
#### 3. Species Distribution
-	Analysed the distribution of iris species in the dataset.
-	Plotted bar charts to visualize the frequency of each species.
#### 4. Statistical Analysis
-	Calculated correlation coefficients to understand the linear relationships between features.
-	Used boxplots to see how the categorical values distributed with other numerical values.
-	Detected the outliers using IQR and then removed them. 
## Results
After performed EDA on Iris Dataset and used Power BI tool to see the relations, correlation, trends and patterns between different parameters we come to this results-
####  Sepal Characteristics:

1. Setosa: Smaller sepal lengths but larger sepal widths.
2. Versicolor: Middle ground in sepal length and width.
3. Virginica: Larger sepal lengths but smaller sepal widths.
####  Petal Characteristics:

1. Setosa: Smaller petal lengths and widths.
2. Versicolor: Intermediate in petal length and width.
3. Virginica: Largest petal lengths and widths.
####  Frequency Peaks:

1. Sepal Length: Highest between 30 and 35 (5.5 to 6).
2. Sepal Width: Peaks around 70 (3.0 to 3.5).
3. Petal Length: Peaks around 50 (1 to 2).
4. Petal Width: Peaks between 40 and 50 (0.0 to 0.5).
####  Overlap Analysis:

1. Sepal Length: Substantial overlapping.
2. Sepal Width: Significant overlapping.
3. Petal Length: Minimal overlapping.
4. Petal Width: Minimal overlapping.
#### Correlations:

1. Petal Width and Petal Length: High correlations.
2. Petal Length and Sepal Width: Good correlations.
3. Petal Width and Sepal Length: Good correlations.
#### Species Traits:

1. Setosa: Smallest features, less distributed with outliers.
2. Versicolor: Average features.
3. Virginica: Highest features.













## Conclusion
The analysis of the Iris dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of different iris species. By exploring the relationships between features, we gain a better understanding of how these measurements can be used to classify iris flowers accurately.
