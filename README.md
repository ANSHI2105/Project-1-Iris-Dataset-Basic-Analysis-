# Project-1-Iris-Dataset-Basic-Analysis-
## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the analysis performed on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset, consists of measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset contains four features for each flower:
1.	Sepal Length (in centimeters)
2.	Sepal Width (in centimeters)
3.	Petal Length (in centimeters)
4.	Petal Width (in centimeters)

Analysis Steps
1. Data Exploration
•	Checked for missing values and ensured data integrity.
•	Explored basic statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for each feature.
•	Visualized the distribution of each feature using histograms.
2. Data Visualization
•	Created scatter plots to examine relationships between different features.
•	Employed pair plots for a comprehensive view of interactions between features.
•	Used box plots to identify variations in measurements across different iris species.
3. Species Distribution
•	Analysed the distribution of iris species in the dataset.
•	Plotted bar charts to visualize the frequency of each species.
4. Statistical Analysis
•	Calculated correlation coefficients to understand the linear relationships between features.
•	Used boxplots to see how the categorical values distributed with other numerical values.
•	Detected the outliers using IQR and then removed them. 
Results
After performed EDA on Iris Dataset and used Power BI tool to see the relations, correlation, trends and patterns between different parameters we come to this results-
•	Species Setosa has smaller sepal lengths but larger sepal widths.
•	Versicolor Species lies in the middle of the other two species in terms of sepal length and width
•	Species Virginica has larger sepal lengths but smaller sepal widths.
•	     Species Setosa has smaller petal lengths and widths.

•	Versicolor Species lies in the middle of the other two species in terms of petal length and width
•	Species Virginica has the largest of petal lengths and widths.
•	species Setosa has the smallest of petals widths and lengths. It also has the smallest sepal length but larger sepal widths.
•	The highest frequency of the sepal length is between 30 and 35 which is between 5.5 and 6
•	The highest frequency of the sepal Width is around 70 which is between 3.0 and 3.5
•	The highest frequency of the petal length is around 50 which is between 1 and 2
•	The highest frequency of the petal width is between 40 and 50 which is between 0.0 and 0.5
•	In the case of Sepal Length, there is a huge amount of overlapping.
•	In the case of Sepal Width also, there is a huge amount of overlapping.
•	In the case of Petal Length, there is a very little amount of overlapping.
•	In the case of Petal Width also, there is a very little amount of overlapping.
•	Petal width and petal length have high correlations. 
•	Petal length and sepal width have good correlations.
•	Petal Width and Sepal length have good correlations.
•	Species Setosa has the smallest features and less distributed with some outliers.
•	Species Versicolor has the average features.
•	Species Virginica has the highest features







Conclusion
The analysis of the Iris dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of different iris species. By exploring the relationships between features, we gain a better understanding of how these measurements can be used to classify iris flowers accurately.
